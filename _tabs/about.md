Highly motivated and skilled full-stack developer and cybersecurity enthusiast with expertise in web development
and penetration testing. Currently pursuing a degree in Digital Development and Cybersecurity Engineering at the
National School of Applied Sciences Fes (ENSAF). Eager to apply my technical skills, including ethical hacking, full-stack
development, and risk management, to a challenging role in the tech industry.

I write about:
